# What is markdown & Rmarkdown?

.pull-left[
The genious behind markdown is that since it is all in _plain text_, the documents can be read by anyone without special sofware _as is_.
This makes the documents more traceable and also makes then able to be version controlled with, for instence, git. 
]

.pull-right[
Rmarkdown is based on markdown, which uses rich text formatting to create content. 
Rmarkdown is a specialized markdown type, where you can embed bits of code and have either or both of code and output rendered in your document.
This makes Rmarkdown a completely transparent and integrated way of working with text and data simultaneously.

## So it's just text?

Basically, yes.

While any text-editor that understands markdown (many new editors do) will render the formatted text, even without the rendering anyone with a text-editor can _read_ the text in the file. 

This makes is easy to share with people who might not have access to specialized, expensive tools can still access the documents. 

---
## Rmarkdown special

.pull-left[
Uses `code-chunks`. 
Chunks are pieces of code that can be **evaluates** (ie run),
and produce some output. 

It is through code chunks you will add R-code (or even other engines!)
to be executed and that can produce some output to be added to the document.

The below code is executed and the plot to the right is produced

````
```{r "ggplot-ex", eval = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, disp)) + 
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Example output")
```
````
]

.pull-right[
```{r "ggplot-ex-exec", ref.label="ggplot-ex", echo = FALSE, out.height='450px'}
```

Most commonly Rmarkdown is turned into another document type using {knitr} and pandoc

# Parametrise your reports

## What are parametrised reports?

Do you periodically need to make a report containing more or less the same information, but with different data?

Tedious, time consuming and not the most inspiring work we do!

## pdf tricks

figure and table captions in pdf files can be a little awkward,  
especially if you want them to have formatting. 

While `fig.cap` _should_ support markdown formatting,  
it does not always succeed.

We can get the figure caption pre-formatted before the chunk and  
then provide this instead.

```{plain}
(ref:figure2-cap) Caption for this very awesome figure. **A** it has sub-plots, **B** so it needs to be _pre-formatted_. 

r 'figure2', fig.cap='(ref:figure2-cap)'}

```

## html tricks

In the top `yaml` part you can point to a document containing any css you want to apply to your document.

```yaml
---
output:
  html_document:
    css: "custom.css"
---
```

but you can also make code chunks of css within your rmarkdown document it self!

````
```{css}
h1 {
font-size: 31px;
}
``` 
````

## Xaringan tricks

- adding `???` before `---` gives you presenter notes (toggle them in browser by pressing `p`)
- you can use two-colum layout by using `.pull-left[]` and `.pull-right[]`  
- want code one place, but code output another? 
    - give your code chunk a name, and set `eval = FALSE`
    - create another code chunk and use `ref.label = 'chunk_name_to_execute'`

# Mistakes I made & what I learned  

---

## What could possibly go wrong?

--

**When naming code chunks, don't use `_` (underscore), but `-` (dash)**   
Some times when converting to pdf the underscore will cause issues  

--

**When you get latex errors, start stripping down your document untill you find the problem part**  
Some character or character combinations in latex make it break, these are tricky to parse out

--

**Html is easier to render than pdf**  
because you dont need to go through latex, and then get latex errors you dont understand.
If you can "get away" with html reports do that!

--

**Customising html reports is easier than pdf**  
same as above. It is easier to learn a couple of css tricks, than to figure out how to make a latex template!

--

**Lists need _two_ spaces after each element**  
Rmarkdown and markdown will not create a line break (even if text is on different consecutive lines) unless there are _two_ spaces at the end of a line
  - double line break (i.e. consecutive lines have a blank line between them) usually creates a larger line space and is usually not what you are after, so remember the double space at the end

## The clean environment

--

**Rmarkdown runs in a completely clean R environment.**  

--

**Nothing in your current working environment will affect compiling your document.**

--

**This is good because it means the document is reproducible.**

--

**This is frustrating _to begin with_ because it is an unfamiliar way of working to many.**

--

**But working like this is the best way of working, learn from it and adopt it as a general coding style.**

## Bookdown
.pull-left[
While writing single reports is quite common, so is also writing book-style reports.  
Book-style reports include chapters, table of contents, appendices etc.    
These are not arbitrary to compile and set up.

Bookdown to the rescue. 
Create lovely books in html, pdf, or even e-book format!

## Pagedown

.pull-left[
html documents usually are a single page, that can be scrolled for ever and ever an ever.  
Some times, you'd like to have pages also in html, without needing to do pdf or create an  
entire bookdown book.

Pagedown helps you do this, making really sleek paginated html reports.

Pagedown also has templates for html resumes, business cards and more!

Making presentations takes times, making pretty presentations take lots of time.
Especially when you are trying to integrate code and output, perhaps you, like me, often make presentations on how come code works? 

Xaringan is an amazing package to creating presentations in Rmarkdown. It creates html slides, which can then easily be hosted and distributed online!
This presentation is made in Xaringan!!
